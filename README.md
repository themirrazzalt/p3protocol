# The P3 Network Protocol

## What is P3?
P3 (aka PPP/Psuedo P2P) is a network developed by Sys36 for use in the Windows 96 web OS.
A P3 network consists of 2 types of devices: the P3 server, and the devices using the P3 network.
P3 uses SocketIO to simulate a P2P network over WebSockets and HTTP(s). The main goal is to have P2P-like functionality within Windows 96.

## P3 Network "Relay" Server
The server is the most important part. It operates basically the entire network.
Without a P3 network "relay" server, you wouldn't be able to simulate a P2P network.

## P3 Keys
A P3 key is base-64 encoded text. These keys are usually generated by generating random hexidecimals or text, and then encoding them with base-64.
A P3 key is used to allow the relay server to identify which device you are on.
The server then assigns you a P3 address, a collection of random letters and numbers that ends in `.ppp`.
Your P3 address is associated with your P3 key, so transferring your P3 key to a different device allows you to retain your current P3 address.

## Connection and Handshake
When your device connects to a P3 network, it sends the `hello` event to the relay server.
It includes one paramater, which is your P3 key.
```js
socket.emit("hello", "your_p3_key_here")
```
> Note: JavaScript and JSON examples will not always be shown.

Your device then recieves a `hello` event from the relay server.
If your device successfully connects to the P3 network, it will contain data similar to this:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "address": "ba9odkq4d.ppp"
